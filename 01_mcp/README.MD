## 🚀 Why MCP Matters
1. **Simplifies AI Development** – one standard instead of custom integrations.  
2. **More Powerful Agents** – connect to calendars, files, databases, etc.  
3. **Real-Time AI** – fetch live data like stock prices or weather.  
4. **Ecosystem Growth** – open-source servers for GitHub, Slack, VS Code, etc.  
5. **Security First** – OAuth 2.1 ensures safe data access.
