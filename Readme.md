# AI Protocols for Agentic Systems

This repo explains key communication protocols used in building scalable and interoperable AI agent systems.  
The protocols are organized step by step — from basic communication to advanced AI-focused standards.

## Directory Structure

### 01_mcp_concepts/
- Basics of communication protocols  
- Examples:  
  - **HTTP** – standard web communication  
  - **REST** – scalable web services  
  - **Streamable HTTP** – streaming data  
  - **JSON-RPC** – simple inter-service calls  

### 02_model_context_protocol/ (MCP)
- Defines how AI models (like LLMs) connect with external tools, data, and services.  
- Standardizes **context management, function calling, and tool integration**.  

### 03_a2a/ (Agent2Agent Protocol)
- Framework for **secure communication between AI agents**.  
- Supports collaboration, task sharing, and multi-agent systems.  

### 04_llms_txt/
- Standard for websites to set rules for AI agents (like `robots.txt` but for AI).  
- Ensures **responsible AI interactions** with web content.

## Why This Matters
- **Simplicity** – Clear protocol layers  
- **Scalability & Resilience** – Optimized for performance and reliability  
- **Open Standards** – Prevents vendor lock-in and ensures interoperability  

This repo gives developers a roadmap to build strong and future-ready AI agent systems.
